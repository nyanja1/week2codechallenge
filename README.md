## Shopping list

This project implements a basic shopping list webpage where users can add items, mark them as purchased, and clear the entire list. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for dynamic interaction with the user.

## Features

#### Add Items

Users can enter items into an input field and click the "Add" button to append them to the shopping list.
git

#### Mark Purchased

Items in the list can be marked as purchased by clicking on them. This action toggles a visual indicator (strikethrough) to signify the item has been acquired.

Clear List: The "Clear List" button allows users to remove all items from the shopping list in one action.

## Implementation Details

HTML Structure: The webpage includes an input field for entering items, a list container and buttons for adding items, marking items as purchased, and clearing the list.

\*JavaScript: DOM manipulation is handled through JavaScript to dynamically add new list items, toggle the purchased state of items, and clear the list.

Array Management: JavaScript arrays are used to store and manage the list of shopping items. This array is manipulated based on user interactions (adding, marking, clearing).
